#This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

#on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 

#except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 

#unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Refer to the flow chart here: https://bit.ly/36BjS2D

if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year.")
    else:
      print("Not leap year.")
  else:
    print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
